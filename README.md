  Structure of the code
  </h3>

</div>

<h4>
Construction Worlds & Actors 
</h4>
A distinction is made between the main classes World & Actuator. In World are all objects that have to be there since the beginning, like the **platforms, monsters, coins & the ground**. In Aktor all objects come in that have to interact, like **Coin, Mario & the Kroopas** as an example.
