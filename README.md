  Structure of the code
  </h3>

</div>

<h4>
Construction Worlds & Actors 
</h4>
A distinction is made between the main classes World & Actuator. In World are all objects that have to be there since the beginning, like the <strong>platforms, monsters, coins & the ground</strong>. In Aktor all objects come in that have to interact, like <strong>Coin, Mario & the Kroopas</strong> as an example.

<h4>
Structure of a class
</h4>
1. First, if needed, an object is created for the animation. <br>
2. All variables are defined with their data type that are needed. <br>
3. After that all methods are called <br>
4. Then we come to the individual methods.  <br>
5. These are ordered by relevance

<h4>
Naming
</h4>
The methods & variables were written in lower case at the beginning and the second word in upper case. First, it describes what it does and then the description. 
Example: newWorld() 

<br>

<b>
new 
</b>
<br>
Stands for something new create
<br>
<b>
World
</b>
<br>
What new should be created
